## Experience as a software engineer on Google Groups
### Jul '19 - Jun '21

At Google, I worked Google Groups in the Apps org, with a focus on data pipelining, backend migrations, full stack feature implementations, cross team plugin integrations, and production management. Most of the implementation work was done in Java.

Here are some of the projects I worked on:

### Data export
* Owned improvement and maintenance of Google Group's cross-team data export integration
* Owned preparation, communication, and final AI resolution for a major update of features to Google Groups's data export integration
* Led launch and approval process up to the director level for this update
* Submitted 89 reviewed changes and reviewed 32 others related to this work
* Owned and performed mitigation and impact analysis related to several postmortems
* Created automated test specs for full coverage over existing manual testing, implemented those automated tests, and added the tests to an Apps-wide launch approval tracker.

### Internal migration of two APIs
* Completed a complex, time-sensitive, client-transparent migration of multiple Google-external APIs
* Owned complete migration of one API across 86 reviewed changes and 39 tracked tickets.
* Co-owned migration of another api across 46 code changes, 11 config changes, and 17 rollout commits, as well as reviewing  48 other changes.


### Experimental design
* Designed an experimental feature across the stack, engaging both technical and managerial expertise.
* Major co-author to an experimental design with the goal of increasing engagement
* Design included UX, frontend, backend, and storage development.
* Worked with team leads, project managers, UX, legal, and privacy to ensure buy-in on all fronts.

### Direct customer feature work
* Designed a customer-specific feature from the ground up
* Met with the customer, and along with my project manager iterated on potential resolution to their needs.
* Sole owner and designer of new functionality to support their needs, making use of my previous experience with our external APIs, and working across our stack to design an implementation meeting the needs of the feature.
* With assistance from my manager, coordinated buy-in and work commitment on the scale of weeks from three other internal teams.



## Computer science education
### Aug '16 - May '19

I graduated with a Bachelor's of Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2019, averaging a 3.8 GPA over the following classes:

Data Structures, Computer Organization, Foundations of Computer Science, Intro to Algorithms, Computer Algorithms, Principles of Software, Database Systems, Intro to Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Software Design and Documentation, Machine Learning From Data, Computational Finance, Programming Languages, Operating Systems, Principles of Program Analysis, Game Architecture

## Projects
### Sudoku [Live demo](/sudoku)
A [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) implementation of sudoku

### Mnist [Live demo](/mnist_model)
A [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) supported grid, with an mnist model i trained loaded in javascript in the browser. As you draw, the model will guess the number.

### [Apple worm](https://github.com/CharlesFauman/AppleWorm)
A java implementation of the game apple worm, originally from https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-apple-worm

### [Halite 3 bot](https://github.com/CharlesFauman/halite_3_bot)
Halite 3 was a fun competition, done in 2018. My friend and I each worked on our own bots in python, and then combined our efforts into a java bot. We placed 179 out of 4014 players: https://2018.halite.io/programming-competition-leaderboard?username=CharlesFauman

### [Sudoku solver](https://github.com/CharlesFauman/sudoku-solver)
A sudoku solver written in C++, done by converting the problem into a constraint satisfaction problem and applying a solver.

### [Connect 4 arena](https://github.com/CharlesFauman/Connect_Four)
Created an arena to run tournaments between four bots. My connect four bot can also be found under Programs/Charlie_sourcecode/main.cpp

### [Pong game](https://github.com/CharlesFauman/SFML)
A simple pong game written in C++ using the SFML library

## Values
If I had to list out three words to describe my work ethic, they would be these:
* Inquisitiveness - I ask questions about everything if I am learning something. I will question things that are implied to be obvious if they are not obvious to me. I will play devil's advocate with my own reasoning for the sake of getting in depth on something so that I can learn more.
* Minimalism - I will try to do the least amount of work possible to get something done. I will spend time seeing what I spend a lot of time on, and then find ways to not spend a lot of time on it. I am ok if things don't get done if I don't think that they absolutely need to happen.
* Spontaneity - I will go deep into various interests that change on a weekly basis. I will be interested in doing random things just to try them out.

## Strengths
* Learning, exploring, absorbing, and asking about everything related to whatever I'm working on to get a deeper understanding of how what I'm doing fits in with a broader picture.
* If I have an end goal that I want to reach, I am very good at persevering and getting around blockers as long as I really care about reaching my goal
* I really want to do everything, which is of course impossible. So a skill I've developed is effective reprioritization. In other words, I am quick to adapt my estimation for how much work something will take, and how much value it will create, and reprioritize my goals based on that.


## What I like about software engineering
* Learning new programming languages and paradigms, software architecture, product design, and ingenious solutions to any problem
* Being able to think about a solution and immediately develop and use it
* Exploring and discovering the simplest solutions to problems
* Improving performance of existing solutions
* Thinking about product decisions and prioritization and tradeoffs with the existing implementation in mind
* Having my opinions and ideas respected and thoroughly considered, if not acted upon
